# A-journey-to-learn-Python-modules
at this repository I will introduce the python application one by one.

most of these repositories are used on my sample projects and i will put their link here.
you can see the list of the practical modules:
>1. EasyGUI : this is a module for very simple, very easy GUI programming in Python. EasyGUI is different from other GUI generators in that EasyGUI is NOT event-driven. Instead, all GUI interactions are invoked by simple function calls.
>for see more touch the link : (http://easygui.sourceforge.net/)
>2. tkinter : The tkinter package (“Tk interface”) is the standard Python interface to the Tcl/Tk GUI toolkit. Both Tk and tkinter are available on most Unix platforms, including macOS, as well as on Windows systems. touch this link (https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)
