# A-journey-to-learn-Python-modules
at this repository I will introduce the python application one by one.

most of these repositories are used on my sample projects and i will put their link here.
you can see the list of the practical modules:
>1. EasyGUI : this is a module for very simple, very easy GUI programming in Python. EasyGUI is different from other GUI generators in that EasyGUI is NOT event-driven. Instead, all GUI interactions are invoked by simple function calls.
>for see more touch the link : (http://easygui.sourceforge.net/)
>2. tkinter : The tkinter package (“Tk interface”) is the standard Python interface to the Tcl/Tk GUI toolkit. Both Tk and tkinter are available on most Unix platforms, including macOS, as well as on Windows systems. touch this link (https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) and (https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/firstexample.html)
>3. glob:The glob module is a useful part of the Python standard library. glob (short for global) is used to return all file paths that match a specific pattern.
We can use glob to search for a specific file pattern, or perhaps more usefully, search for files where the filename matches a certain pattern by using wildcard characters. touch the link for more:(https://towardsdatascience.com/the-python-glob-module-47d82f4cbd2d)
>4. pycoingecko: it is a API to gather the coinGecko markrt information 
>5. HTTP request: at this notebook we used python library to send request to the server with HTTP protocol
>6. pycaret is library that help you to visualize your data in the best way!! by clusteing algorithm and cubing tools! have fun! :)
